# Map Random Coordinates

## About
Does what it says on the box - retrieves a list of coordinates from an API and maps them. 

## Tech
This repo was originally cloned from here:
`https://github.com/covalence-io/barebones-react-typescript-express`

The original repo is a barebones setup that contains react, typescript and express so I can focus on writing code and not setting up boilerplate.
